NightOwl: Nocturne Division, mobilize. We’re on the site at ten. Roll Call
Huginn//Echo: Huginn here
Castellan-5: Castellan here
C3RB-0X: C3RB-0X here
Ezekiel Z3K Cross: Z3K here
NightOwl: Today’s gonna be an interesting mission. In all my years of experience at Bank Army, I’ve never seen something like half a city getting vaporized. Well… besides the time that Nuke was dropped on that one city…
Huginn//Echo: Nukes make sense. I understand nukes. This… doesn’t… Some of the reports… Unbelievable
Castellan-5: Doesn’t matter the reports, our firepower will punch through them all the same.
C3RB-0X: And behold, a pale horse: and he who sat upon him was Death, and Hell followed with him.
Everyone looks around nervously at each other
Ezekiel Z3K Cross: Revelations 6:8 
Huginn//Echo: You religious cross?

Ezekiel Z3K Cross: My mother was…
Awkward silence
NightOwl: Regardless of what is out there. We will overcome it. That’s what we do. Eyes on the prize. This ain’t our first rodeo and sure ain’t mine.

NightOwl: Cerb, Huginn, Castellan, y’all are going to be holding off the outer perimeter, try to contain the damage that has been done, investigate anything out of the ordinary in the city.There is currently a military force around the perimeter attempting to limit the spread out of the city, but we have no clue how long it will hold.
Huginn//Echo, C3RB-0X, and Castellan-5 nod
NightOwl: Z3K
Z3K: Yeah?
NightOwl: We’re going straight into the heart of it. You will be going into the anomaly and investigating inside. Hope you’re ready. I will hold them off.
Z3K: Understood
NightOwl: Good

Everyone nervously looks at each other, with the exception of NightOwl, who can me seen with a faint smirk
The helicopter flies over to the edge of the crater and lands. In the crater what looks to be glowing monsters litter the battlefield
Castellan-5: Looks like the reports were true…
Huggin//Echo: My god… are those actually…
C3RB-0X: Angels…
Z3K: …
NightOwl: To your positions Nocturne Division. Z3K, rush inside, I’ll keep them off your tail.
